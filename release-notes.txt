### Release v2.3

### New Features

* LuxCoreUI now shows eye and light pass counters if light tracing is enabled
* FILESAVER now expands inline exported constant texture values
* PhotonGI caustic scene re-factored to work with Vertex Merging (i.e. SPPM in this case)
* It is now possible to use light tracing for normal caustics and PhotonGI cache for SDS paths
* Added the support for shadow rays transparency for path tracers (aka hybrid glass, issue #233)
* Added the support for Basu and Owen's low discrepancy triangle light sampling (pull request #246)
* Added an option to normalize BlackBody texture output
* Pointiness shape is now able to handle duplicate/similar vertices like if they were the same
* Added the support for Subdivison shape (base don OpenSubdiv)
* Added the support for Displacement shape
* Added the support for vector displacement to Displacement shape
* New image pipeline plugin: White balance
* Using/Not using bump/normal mapping doesn't requires OpenCL compilation anymore (removed PARAM_HAS_BUMPMAPS conditional OpenCL compilation)
* Large rework of internal light interface. Fixed several instance/motion blur and lights related problems. Triangle light motion blur now works as expected in OpenCL.
* Large rework of internal mesh interface. Improved the performance of instanced and motion blur meshes.
* Changed object and material ID for background to 0 (from 0xffffffff)
* Added the support for screen space subdivision limit to SubdivShape
* Using/Not using any type of transparency doesn't requires OpenCL compilation anymore (removed PARAM_HAS_PASSTHROUGH conditional OpenCL compilation)

### Fixed Bugs

* Fixed triangle lights back face emission when using an IES or image map profile
* Fixed OpenCL code for rotate triangle light when using IES or image map profile (BlendLuxCore iusse #310)

### Known Problems
* LuxCore API requires latin locale
* accelerator.bvh.builder.type = EMBREE_MORTON doesn't work with the latest Embree
* Python crashes when calling sys.exit()
* TILEPATHOCL (and RTPATHOCL) count the layers of transparent surfaces as an iteration of the rendering finite state machine so they requires to increase the max. path depth to avoid black regions.
* Light emitted by motion blurred triangle lights is aproximated using the triangle area of time 0.0 (computing triangle area at runtime would be expansive) so it may be not totally accurate if the motion blur transformation include a scale.

**Note for Windows users:** you have to install the [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable
for Visual Studio 2017](https://aka.ms/vs/15/release/vc_redist.x64.exe).
